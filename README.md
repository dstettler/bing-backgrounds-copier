# `copier.py`

This is a simple utility that just copies files from the directories Windows/Bing saves the Bing desktop and Windows Spotlight images to a more reachable location.

I personally do not use the apps/programs that this copies files from (I primarily use Linux nowadays), so if you run into problems, please open an issue.
