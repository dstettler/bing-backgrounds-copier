# `copier.py`

This is a simple utility that just copies files from the directories Windows/Bing saves the Bing desktop and Windows Spotlight images to a more reachable location.

Mostly this exists for my family to use since I don't use Bing Wallpaper and I don't like most of the images Windows Spotlight gives me.

Edit this as you need I don't claim any copyright or anything over this since it's a single Python script with a hyper-specific usage. `:^)`
